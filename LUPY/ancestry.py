This module contains all the ancestry classes. These classes allow a node in a hierarchy 
to reference any other node in the hierarchy provided that each node of the hierarchy inherits
from one of the ancestry classes and the method :py:func:`Ancestry.setAncestor` is called to
contect a child node to its parent node.

This module was mainly written to support linking and xpath referencing in a GNDS hierarchy.

    This class is designed to be a base class for a class (instance) that is a member of another
    class (instance). The function of this class is to aid in tracking a class's ancestors and all
    of the ancestors members. That is, if an instance is part of a hierarchy, this class provides 
    methods, for example, that list the position of the instance within the hierarchy or give its 
    position relative to another member in the hierarchy using xlinks.

    This class defines the following members:

        +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | moniker                   | The name associated with the class type.                                                                  |
        +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | ancestor                  | Instance which *self* is a child of.                                                                      |
        +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | keyName                   | The name of the key. The key's value is used by a suite to indentify an element of a suite.               |
        +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | ancestryMembers           | Tuple of names of the members of *self* that inherit from **Ancestry**.                                   |
        +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | legacyMemberNameMapping   | A map whose keys are legacy member names and whose associated values are the current memeber names.       |
        +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | monikerByFormat           | If the moniker had a different name for in a prior format version, then this is a dict of key/value where |
        +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    This class defines the member moniker to be an abstract member, meaning that all classes that inherit from this class must define moniker.
    The main reason for the **keyName** is that is it used by a **Suite** instance to reference (i.e., uniquely identify) its children.

    An instance has the xlink '/the/list/of/ancestors/andSelf' if its attribute member is None or
    '/the/list/of/ancestors/andSelf[@attribute="value"]' if its attribute member is not None where each string
    part of the xpath the value of the moniker for that node. For example,
    for a hierarchy consisting of::

        class A with moniker 'nameA' and 
            member mB of class B, class B with moniker 'nameB' and 
                member mC of class C and class C with moniker 'nameC',

    then the xlink for an instance of a C class in the hierarchy is '/nameA/nameB/nameC'. If the mC instance
    set the attribute member to 'greeting', then for this example with value 'Hi', then the
    xlink for the C class is '/nameA/nameB/nameC[@greeting="Hi"]'.
