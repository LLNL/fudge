Properties of Particles (PoPs)
==============================

Welcome to documentation for the Properties of Particles (PoPs) database!
PoPs is designed to store information about a range of particles, from leptons and bosons
up to nuclei, atoms, and possibly molecules. Properties like mass, charge, spin and parity, half-life
and decay properties can be added to each particle in the database. The database offers a quick way to
access any particle that it contains.
