# Merced

Merced is a C++ library for processing double-differential cross sections. It is used for converting differential cross sections defined in the center-of-mass frame to the laboratory frame, and for converting angle-energy distributions to Legendre moments needed for deterministic transport.

Merced is distributed as part of the FUDGE package.
