    For *initialState*, determines the multiplicity (i.e., total probability) that a photon from
    level *initialState* or any level it decays to is emitted. Data are added to *completePhotons*
    as needed. *completePhotons* is a dictionary with keys "inital:final" where "initial" and final

    represent the decay of initial to final leading to the emission of a photon. For example,
    for the decay from level "Fe56_e6" to level "Fe56_e3" the key is "Fe56_e6:Fe56_e3". The data
    for each key is the energy difference of the initial and final levels and the multiplicity (i.e., 
    totoal probability) that the photon was emitted. For example, for Fe56 in ENDF/B-VIII.0., the
    data for the key "Fe56_e6:Fe56_e3" are "[PQU( "462521.000000000 eV" ), 0.009888135544683001]".

def photonBranchingData(pops, id):
    '''
    This function summarizes all photon branches for the specified nuclide. The returned object is a dictionary with 
    keys "energy", "photons" and "completePhotons". The value of the "energy" key is the energy level of the nucleus. 
    The value of the "photons" key is a list of information about the the photons (i.e., gammas) emittied from the decay
    of the nucleus.  For each photo, the information is the tuple branching ratio, **PQU** of the photon energy, final 
    nuclear state and photon emission probability. For example, for Fe56_e9 in ENDF/B-VIII.0, the data in the "photons" key is:

    [ ( 0.013, PQU( "0.265580000000000 MeV" ), "Fe56_e7", 0.9875568 ), 
      ( 0.987, PQU( "1.303445 MeV" ), "Fe56_e2", 0.999862 ) ]

    These data state that the Fe56_e9 nuclear level decays to Fe56_e7 0.13% of time emitting a photon of 
    energy 0.26558 MeV 98.75568% of the time, and it decays to Fe56_e2 98.7% of time emitting a photon of 
    energy 1.303445 MeV 99.9862% of the time.

    The value of the "completePhotons" key is a dictionary. Each key in the dictionary is comprised of the initial
    and final state ids for each emtted photon in the format "intial:final" (e.g., "Fe56_e6:Fe56_e3") which means 
    that it is the photon emitted from the transition from the initial level to the final level (e.g., from level 
    "Fe56_e6" to level "Fe56_e3"). The data for each key is the energy of the emitted photon and its multiplicity.
    The multiplicity is the total probability that this photon is emitted.
    These data are obtained by calling the function **completePhotonBranchingData**.
