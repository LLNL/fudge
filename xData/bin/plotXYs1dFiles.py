Reads 1d data from each file listed into an XYs1d instance and plots all on a single plot using XYs1d.multiPlot.
The data in each file must be in columns and currently only columns 1 and 2 of each file are plotted.
The '#' character is treated as a comment character and, for each line, it and all remaining character 
on the line are ignored. Also, blank lines, after the comment is removed, are ignored.
