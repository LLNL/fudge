# FUDGE (For Updating Data and Generating Evaluations)

**FUDGE** is a nuclear data package built around Python that supports reading, viewing, modifying,
writing and processing nuclear data in the **GNDS** format.

The current release of **FUDGE** focuses on supporting version 2.0 of the Generalized Nuclear Database Structure (**GNDS**).
The **FUDGE** package includes tools to translate other nuclear data formats to and from **GNDS**,
plus tools for testing, visualizing, and processing **GNDS** data.

# Contents of this README:

- Getting Started
- Basic Use (translating ENDF files)
- Getting Help

## Getting Started:

Installing **FUDGE** only requires Python (version 3.6 or higher) and NumPy (version 1.15 or higher).
Optional packages matplotlib and PyQT5 are also recommended to support plotting. 

### The following installation options are currently supported:

- Installation via `pip install`: This is ideal for use in virtual environments. The 
      following steps are recommended to `pip install` FUDGE:

    - Create a new virtual environment if desired. For example, using Anaconda:
 
          conda create --name fudge python=3.8 numpy matplotlib PyQT
          conda activate fudge

      Some users have reported problems with installing PyQT with conda on Windows. It may be ommitted from the
      above `conda create` command and, if required, be installed via `pip install`.
    
    - Ensure that NumPy (version 1.15 or higher) and wheels are present in the Python environment.
  
          python
          import numpy
          print( numpy.__version__ )
          import wheel
          exit()

    - Install FUDGE:
     
          pip install git+https://github.com/LLNL/fudge.git@6.4.0


- Installation by cloning the git repository and building with the unix `make` command: 
  This is the typical mode for active FUDGE maintenance and development.
  The following steps are recommended:

    - Ensure that NumPy (version 1.15 or higher) is installed

    - Clone FUDGE in the current directory: 
     
        git clone https://github.com/LLNL/fudge.git
        # or using SSH (requires creating a github account and registering an ssh key):
        git clone git@github.com:LLNL/fudge.git
     
    - Build FUDGE:

          cd fudge; make -s

    - [Optional] Set environment variables. For general use of the FUDGE package, 
          some changes should be made to your computer's environment. The following lines 
          make the required change. Note that <path_to_FUDGE> indicates the path to the 
          directory containing this README.md file.

      - on unix with the bash, ksh, or similar shell, put the following line in the 
          .bashrc or equivalent file:

            export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path_to_FUDGE>

      - on csh, tcsh or similar shell into the appropriate shell file:

            setenv PYTHONPATH $PYTHONPATH:<path_to_FUDGE>

      - on Windows, the environment variable should be added to the registry (see for 
          example <http://www.support.tabs3.com/main/R10463.htm>)

### Differences between FUDGE installed via `pip install` vs. via `make`:

When FUDGE is installed via `pip install`, several executable scripts are installed into 
the virtual environment 'bin' directory and can be used directly. The same behavior can be achieved
using the `make` installation method by adding <path_to_FUDGE>/bin and <path_to_FUDGE>/brownies/bin to the PATH.


## Basic Use:

After installing **FUDGE**, a user may be interested in translating an **ENDF-6** file into a **GNDS** file and vice versa.
Two tools for translating **GNDS** files to and from **ENDF-6** files are included in the *brownies/bin* directory.

The Python script **endf2gnds.py** translations an **ENDF-6** file to a **GNDS** file. 
This script writes a **GNDS** file containing the **reactionSuite** node and, if covariance data are 
present in the ENDF-6 file, its also writes a **GNDS** file containing the **covarianceSuite** node.

For example, the following command translating the **ENDF/B-VIII.0** file 
n-001_H_001.endf and generates n-001_H_001.xml and n-001_H_001-covar.xml:
```
python3 -m brownies.bin.endf2gnds.py n-001_H_001.endf n-001_H_001.xml

# or, if FUDGE was installed via pip:
endf2gnds.py n-001_H_001.endf n-001_H_001.xml
```

Some ENDF-6 files fail to translate unless the `--continuumSpectraFix` option is included when calling endf2gnds.
This option addresses a problem with unnormalizeable continuum photon spectra. It has no effect unless an evaluation
contains an unnormalizeable spectrum so can be used safely for all translations. Sample use:
```
endf2gnds.py <originalFile.endf> <newFile.xml> --continuumSpectraFix
```

The Python script **gnds2endf.py** translates a **GNDS** file to an **ENDF-6** file. This
script will look for a corresponding covariance file and, if present, add its data to the **ENDF-6** 
result. For example, the following translates the *n-001_H_001.xml* file generated in the **endf2gnds.py** comannd above 
back into an **ENDF-6** file:
```
python3 -m brownies.bin.gnds2endf.py n-001_H_001.xml

# or,
gnds2endf.py n-001_H_001.xml
```

**FUDGE** scripts use the **argparse.py** module to parse input arguments. To get *help* on a script, run the script
with the *-h* option. For example, to get help on the usage of the *bin/processProtare.py* script execute:
```
<path_to_FUDGE>/bin/processProtare.py -h
```

There are more scripts in the *bin* directory that a user may find useful. One can also run **FUDGE** interactively.
The following Python commands show how to read in the *n-001_H_001.xml* generated by the example above, print a list
of its reactions and plot each reaction's cross section on a single plot:
```
from fudge import GNDS_file     # FUDGE must be in the PYTHONPATH.
n_H1 = GNDS_file.read( 'n-001_H_001.xml' )
for reaction in n_H1.reactions: print( reaction )

crossSections = []
for reaction in n_H1.reactions:
    crossSection = reaction.crossSection.toPointwise_withLinearXYs( lowerEps = 1e-7 )
    crossSection.plotLegendKey = str( reaction )
    crossSections.append( crossSection )

crossSection.multiPlot( crossSections, rangeMin = 1e-5, xylog = 3,
        title = 'n + U230', xLabel = 'Neutron energy [eV]', yLabel = 'Cross section [b]' )
```

## Note regarding HDF5 support:

**FUDGE** imports the h5py module in some places to read and write HDF5 files. In some circumstances h5py fails to import
if MPI-related environment variables are set. This issue can cause the Python interpreter to crash. The best fix at the
moment is to ensure that environment variable `PMI_FD` is not set before running anything requiring h5py.

## Getting Help:

**FUDGE** documentation is currently undergoing an update but some documentation can be found by executing the following
**make** command in the **FUDGE** directory (note this only works after cloning FUDGE, not with pip install):
```
make -s docs
```
To view the documentation, open the file *doc/sphinx/_build/html/index.html* inside the **FUDGE** directory.
