Introduction
---------------------------

This module contains classes and functions for representing and manipulating a value with units and uncertainty, 
herein called a "Physical Quantity with Uncertainty" or :py:class:`PQU`. For example, if the distance between start and 
finish lines is measured to be '100.1 m' with an uncertainty of '0.4 m', it can be inputted to :py:class:`PQU` as the string
'100.1(4) m' or '100.1 +/- 0.4 m' (both are allowed input forms as well as several others - see :py:class:`PQU`). 

From this module, most users should only need the :py:class:`PQU` class which stores a :py:class:`PQU` object and
supports common math operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) including the operation on 
the units and uncertainty. 
For example, if a person races between the start and finish lines in a time of '16.3 +/- 0.1 s', the :py:class:`PQU` class can 
be used to determine the person's speed as:

>>> from pqu import PQU
>>> distance = PQU.PQU( '100.1(4) m' )
>>> time = PQU.PQU( '16.3 +/- 0.1 s' )
>>> speed = distance / time
>>> print(speed)
6.14 +/- 0.04 m/s
>>> print(speed.copyToUnit( 'mi/h' ))
13.7 +/- 0.1 mi/h

As this example shows, in addition to calculating the speed and unit, the :py:class:`PQU` class also propagated the significant digits and the uncertainty. In this example
the uncertainty was propagated using Goodman's expression for uncorrelated values (see `Uncertainty propagation`_). The
propagation of significant digits explains why the printed speed has only 3 digits. The following Python code illustrates
significant digits for the speed calculation:

>>> print(100.1 / 16.3)
6.14110429448
>>> print(float( speed ))
6.14110429448
>>> print(speed.info( ))
value = 6.14110429447852724e+00, significantDigits = 3, order = 0, isPercent = False, unit = "m/s"
uncertainty = value = 4.49629906071862956e-02, significantDigits = 1, order = -2, isPercent = False

As can be seen, the internal speed value is as expected. However, since the :py:class:`PQU` class (with the help
of the :py:class:`PQU_float` class) tracks a value's significant digits, when a :py:class:`PQU` instance is printed (via the __str__
method), only at most 'significantDigits' are displayed. The allowed range for 'significantDigits' is
1 to sys.float_info.dig + 1 inclusive. For addition and subtraction, the member 'order' is also required and
is why the following output is the same for both print statements:

>>> print(distance)
100.1(4) m
>>> print(distance + '100.1(4) mum')        # note 'mum' is micrometer
100.1 +/- 0.4 m

How is 'significantDigits' determined? That depends on how :py:class:`PQU` is called. If a string without
uncertainty is entered as the only argument then 'significantDigits' is the number of digits in the string
(ignoring leading '0'). Some examples are:

>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.345' ).info( ))
value = 1.23450000000000006e+01, significantDigits = 5, order = 1, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = 
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.34500' ).info( ))
value = 1.23450000000000006e+01, significantDigits = 7, order = 1, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = 
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.34500e-12' ).info( ))
value = 1.23450000000000004e-11, significantDigits = 7, order = -11, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = 
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '0012.34500e-12' ).info( ))
value = 1.23450000000000004e-11, significantDigits = 7, order = -11, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = 
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '00.0012' ).info( ))
value = 1.19999999999999989e-03, significantDigits = 2, order = -3, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = 

If the string has an uncertainty, then it is also used in calculating 'significantDigits'.
Some examples are (note - these are the same as the last examples, with uncertainties added):

>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.345 +/- 1e-8' ).info( ))
value = 1.23450000000000006e+01, significantDigits = 10, order = 1, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = value = 1.00000000000000002e-08, significantDigits = 1, order = -8, isPercent = False
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.345 +/- 1e-8' ))
12.34500000 +/- 1.e-8
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.34500 +/- 0.12' ).info( ))
value = 1.23450000000000006e+01, significantDigits = 4, order = 1, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = value = 1.19999999999999996e-01, significantDigits = 2, order = -1, isPercent = False
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.34500 +/- 0.12' ))
12.35 +/- 0.12
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.34500e-12(32)' ).info( ))
value = 1.23450000000000004e-11, significantDigits = 7, order = -11, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = value = 3.20000000000000023e-16, significantDigits = 2, order = -16, isPercent = False
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.34500e-12(32)' ))
1.234500e-11(32)
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '0012.34500e-12 +/- 32e-15' ).info( ))
value = 1.23450000000000004e-11, significantDigits = 5, order = -11, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = value = 3.20000000000000025e-14, significantDigits = 2, order = -14, isPercent = False
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '0012.34500e-12 +/- 32e-15' ))
1.2345e-11 +/- 3.2e-14
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '00.0012 +/- 0.000002' ).info( ))
value = 1.19999999999999989e-03, significantDigits = 4, order = -3, isPercent = False, unit = ""
uncertainty = value = 1.99999999999999991e-06, significantDigits = 1, order = -6, isPercent = False
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '00.0012 +/- 0.000002' ))
1.200e-3 +/- 2.e-6

The :py:class:`PQU` constructor (i.e., its __init__ method) allows various input options for creating an instance (see :py:class:`PQU`).

A :py:class:`PQU` object has three main members which are:

    * *value* which is stored as a :py:class:`PQU_float` instance,
    * *unit* which is stored as a :py:class:`PQU_uncertainty` instance,
    * *uncertainty* which is stored as a :py:class:`PQU_uncertainty` instance.
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Units and conversions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module uses the SI units along with units for angle and solid angle as its base units. The base units are:

    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+
    | Unit      | symbol| Measure                   |
    +===========+=======+===========================+
    | meter     | 'm'   | length                    |
    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+
    | kilogram  | 'kg'  | mass                      |
    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+
    | second    | 's'   | time                      |
    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+
    | Ampere    | 'A'   | electrical current        |
    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+
    | Kelvin    | 'K'   | thermodynamic temperature |
    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+
    | mole      | 'mol' | amount of substance       |
    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+
    | candela   | 'cd'  | luminous intensity        |
    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+
    | radian    | 'rad' | angle                     | 
    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+
    | steradian | 'sr'  | solid angle               |
    +-----------+-------+---------------------------+

All other units are stored with these units as a base and a conversion factor. 
For example, the unit for foot ('ft') is stored as a meter with the conversion factor of 0.3048.
Any :py:class:`PQU` instance can be represented as a combination of each of these units with an associated power for each unit.
As example, a force has the base units 'kg' and 'm' to power 1 as well as 's' to power -2 (represented as the 
string 'kg * m / s**2').  Two units are said to be compatible if they have the same power for each
base unit. Hence, 'ft' is compatible with 'm' but not 'kg' or 's'. Furthermore, the electron-Volt ('eV') is compatible
with Joule ('J') and Watt-second ('W * s') but not Watt ('W').

The :py:class:`PQU` package has many defined units with prefixes (see `Defined prefixes and units`_). In general, the
PQU methods that operate on :py:class:`PQU` objects do not attempt to simplify the units, even if the result is dimensionless.
Note, to get rid of dimensionless units use the method :py:meth:`PQU.simplify`
For example, consider the division of '3.2 m' by 11.2 km:

>>> from pqu import PQU
>>> x = PQU.PQU( '3.2 m' )
>>> y = PQU.PQU( '11.2 km' )
>>> slope = x / y
>>> print(slope)
0.29 m/km
>>> dl = slope.copyToUnit( "" )
>>> print(dl)
2.9e-4
>>> slope.simplify()
PQU( "2.9e-4" )

Here the method :py:meth:`PQU.copyToUnit` is used to convert the units into a dimensionless form. Here is another
example showing the use of the :py:meth:`PQU.copyToUnit` method:

>>> mass = PQU.PQU( "4.321 g" )
>>> speed = PQU.PQU( "1.234 inch / mus"  )  
>>> energy = mass * speed**2
>>> print(energy)
6.580 inch**2*g/mus**2
>>> energy_joules = energy.copyToUnit( "J" )
>>> print(energy_joules)
4.245e6 J

The method :py:meth:`PQU.inUnitsOf` is useful for returning a physical quantity in units of descending compatible units. 
For example, :py:meth:`PQU.inUnitsOf` will convert '3123452.12 s' into days, hours, minutes and seconds, or just hours and seconds as:

>>> t = PQU.PQU( '3123452.12 s' )
>>> t.inUnitsOf( 'd', 'h', 'min', 's' )
(PQU( "36.0000000 d" ), PQU( "3.000000 h" ), PQU( "37.0000 min" ), PQU( "32.12 s" ))
>>> t.inUnitsOf( 'h',  's' )
(PQU( "867.000000 h" ), PQU( "2252.12 s" ))

Also see the methods :py:meth:`PQU.convertToUnit` and :py:meth:`PQU.getValueAs`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changing non-hardwired constants
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PQU has a set of defined constants that are hardwired and a set that are not hardwired. The non-hardwired
constants reside in the module pqu_constants.py and are import by :py:class:`PQU` when it is first loaded. It is 
possible to change a non-hardwired constant by loading the pqu_constants.py module before :py:class:`PQU` is imported, redefining
the constant and then importing :py:class:`PQU`. For example, as of this writing the elementary charge is defined as '1.60217653e-19 * C':

>>> from pqu import PQU
>>> eV = PQU.PQU( 1, 'eV' )
>>> print(eV)
1. eV
>>> print(eV.copyToUnit( 'J' ))
1.60217653e-19 J

The following lines change the elementary charge to '1.6 * C':

>>> from pqu import pqu_constants
>>> pqu_constants.e = '1.6 * C'
>>> from pqu import PQU                 # This import does not work with doctest as PQU was previously imported.
>>> my_eV = PQU.PQU( 1, 'eV' )
>>> print(my_eV)
1. eV
>>> print(my_eV.copyToUnit( 'J' ))
1.6 J

The python 'reload' function can also be used as:

>>> from pqu import PQU
>>> eV = PQU.PQU( 1, 'eV' )
>>> print(eV)
1. eV
>>> print(eV.copyToUnit( 'J' ))
1.60217653e-19 J
>>> from pqu import pqu_constants
>>> pqu_constants.e = '1.6 * C'
>>> reload( PQU )
<module 'pqu.PQU' from 'pqu/PQU.pyc'>
>>> my_eV = PQU.PQU( 1, 'eV' )
>>> print(my_eV)
1. eV
>>> print(my_eV.copyToUnit( 'J' ))
1.6 J
>>> pqu_constants.e = '1.60217653e-19 * C'      # Needs to be the same as in the module pqu_constants.py for stuff below to pass doctest.
>>> reload( PQU )
<module 'pqu.PQU' from 'pqu/PQU.pyc'>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uncertainty propagation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes the propagation of uncertainties for the binary operators '+', '-', '*' and '/' as well as the power operator
(i.e., '**'). Firstly, a comment on the limits of uncertainty propagation. Uncertainties were added mainly to support the inputting
and outputting (i.e., converting to and from a string) of a physical quantity with an associated uncertainty. As can be seen from the documentation below,
the supported propagations of uncertainties are limited to simple propagation rules.

In the following discussion, Q1, Q2 and Q3 will be :py:class:`PQU` instances with values
V1, V2 and V3 respectively and uncertainties dQ1, dQ2 and dQ3 respectively. In addition, n1 will be a number (i.e., 1.23).

For the binary operators, all numbers are converted to a :py:class:`PQU` instance with uncertainty of 0. For example, the following
are all equivalent:

>>> from pqu import PQU
>>> Q1 = PQU.PQU( '12.3 +/- .2 m' )
>>> print(Q1 * 0.6)
7.4 +/- 0.1 m
>>> print(Q1 * PQU.PQU( '0.6' ))
7.4 +/- 0.1 m
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '0.6' ) * Q1)
7.4 +/- 0.1 m

All binary operators assume that the two operands are uncorrelated except when they are the same instance. When
the two operands are the same instance, 100% correlation is assumed. For example,

>>> print(Q1 - Q1)                      # Operands are the same instance
0. m
>>> print(Q1 - PQU.PQU( '12.3 +/- .2 m' ))  # Operands are not the same instance
0.0 +/- 0.3 m
>>> print(Q1 + Q1)                      # Operands are the same instance
24.6 +/- 0.4 m
>>> print(Q1 + PQU.PQU( '12.3 +/- .2 m' ))  # Operands are not the same instance
24.6 +/- 0.3 m
>>> print(Q1 * Q1)                      # Operands are the same instance
151. +/- 5. m**2
>>> print(Q1 * PQU.PQU( '12.3 +/- .2 m' ))  # Operands are not the same instance
151. +/- 3. m**2
>>> print(Q1 / Q1)                      # Operands are the same instance
1.
>>> print(Q1 / PQU.PQU( '12.3 +/- .2 m' ))  # Operands are not the same instance
1.00 +/- 0.02

There is one exception (depending on your divide-by-zero belief) to this rule of same instance and that happens when the 
value of the operand is 0. Divide-by-zero always executes a raise of 'ZeroDivisionError', even for 'a / a'.

>>> Q2 = PQU.PQU( "0.00 +/- 0.02" )
>>> print(Q2 / "2 +/- 0.5")
0.00 +/- 0.01
>>> print(Q2 / Q2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "PQU.py", line 1189, in __div__
    extraFactor = uncertaintySelf * uncertaintyOther
ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero

For the rest of this discussion, the two binary operands will be assumed to not be the same instance.
For addition and subtraction with :py:class:`PQU` instances Q1 and Q2 as operands the uncertainty is propagated as dQ3 = sqrt( dQ1**2 + dQ2**2 ).
For multiplication with :py:class:`PQU` instances Q1 and Q2 as operands the uncertainty is propagated using Goodman's expression with
uncorrelated values (i.e., as dQ3 = sqrt( ( V2 * dQ1 )**2 + ( V1 * dQ2) **2 + ( dQ1 * dQ2 )**2 )). For division, the expression 'Q1 / Q2'
is converted to 'Q1 * Q3' with 'Q3 = PQU( 1 / V2, unit = 1 / U2, uncertainty = dQ2 / ( V2 * V2 ) )' where U2 is the unit of Q2.

For the power method, simple propagation is perform which is only valid if the uncertainty is small relative to the value. 
This is, for 'Q2 = pow( Q1, n1 )' the uncertainty for Q2 is 'dQ2 = n1 * V1**(n1-1) * dQ1'.
Note, the 'sqrt' method is equivalent to the 'pow' method with power of 0.5.

For the trigonometry methods, no propagation of uncertainty is performed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PQU methods by functionality
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section classifies some of the methods in the :py:class:`PQU` class by their function.

For :py:class:`PQU` methods that require a second operand (e.g., '+', '/'), the second operand will be passed to the
staticmethod :py:meth:`PQU._getOtherAsPQU` to determine if it is a suitable object. A suitable object includes any string that
is a valid :py:class:`PQU`. For example: :py:meth:`PQU.toString`

>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.345' ) + "3.23")
15.58
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '12.345 mm' ) + "3.23m")
3242. mm

**isCompatible**

    Returns **True** if *self*'s unit is compatible with the units of the argument and **False** otherwise.

**isPercent, isDimensionless, isLength, isMass, isTime, isCurrent, isTemperature, isMoles, isLuminousIntensity,
isAngle, isSolidAngle, isEnergy, isSpin, isCharge**

    These methods return **True** if *self* is compatible with the unit implied by the method name.

**__float__**

    This method is called when the a :py:class:`PQU` is the argument to the 'float' function (e.g., float( pqu )).
    This method returns a python float for the value of the :py:class:`PQU` instance. As example:

>>> pqu = PQU.PQU( '13.7 +/- 0.1 mi/h' )
>>> value = float( pqu )
>>> print(type( value ), value)
<type 'float'> 13.7

The :py:class:`PQU` class has methods for the following arithmetic operations. Unless stated, a new :py:class:`PQU` instance is returned.

**__abs__, __neg__**

    These are the standard unitary operators that only operate on the :py:class:`PQU`'s value.

**__add__, __radd__, __iadd__, __sub__, __rsub__, __isub__**

    These are the standard binary operators for addition and subtraction. For these operators, the other
    operand is passed to :py:meth:`PQU._getOtherAsPQU`. The other operand must have units compatible with *self*.
    As expected, the __iadd__ and __isub__ methods modify *self* and return it.

**__mul__, __rmul__, __imul__, __div__, __rdiv__, __idiv__**

    These are the standard binary operators for multiplication and division. For these operators, the other
    operand is passed to :py:meth:`PQU._getOtherAsPQU`. Any unit for other is allowed.
    As expected, the __imul__ and __idiv__ methods modify *self* and
    return it. All these methods call the __mul__ method; except, when a division happens, and '*self* is other'
    and the denominator is not 0.
    That is, the expression 'a / a' is handled as a special case when float( a ) != 0. In this case, a 
    dimensionless :py:class:`PQU` is returned with value 1 and no uncertainty.

    If *self* is not other, the uncertainty is propagated using Goodman's expression for uncorrelated values.
    Otherwise, 100% correlated uncertainty is assumed.

**__pow__**

    This method raises - not in the python sense but in the mathematical sense (i.e., x**y) -
    *self* to a power. Standard uncertainty propagation is performed which is only valid when
    the uncertainty is small compared to the value.  A quantity can be raised to a non-integer power 
    only if the result can be represented by integer powers of the base units.

**__eq__, __ne__, __lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__, compare, equivalent**

    These methods compare *self* to another object. For these operators, the other
    object is passed to :py:meth:`PQU._getOtherAsPQU` and must have the same unit
    as *self*. The first 6 methods all call the :py:func:`compare` method
    with epsilonFactor = 5. All methods except 'equivalent' compare 
    *self*'s and other's values and units only. 
    The 'equivalent' method also considers *self*'s and other's uncertainty.

**convertToUnit, copyToUnit, inUnitsOf, getUnitAsString, getValueAs, getUncertaintyValueAs**

    These methods change a :py:class:`PQU`'s unit or return a new instance.

**truncate**

    This method changes a :py:class:`PQU`'s value and uncertainty to agree with its printed value as defined
    by its significant digits.

**changeUncertaintyStyle, changeUncertaintyPercent**

    These methods allow for the changing of a :py:class:`PQU` instance uncertainty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supporting classes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to the :py:class:`PQU` class, the following classes are a part the the PQU module:
:py:class:`Parsers`, :py:class:`PQU_float`, :py:class:`PQU_uncertainty`, :py:class:`PhysicalUnit` and :py:class:`NumberDict`.
These classes are only intended as helper classes for the :py:class:`PQU` class; hence, they have limited functionality and
are only intended for internal use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
History
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module is based on the Scientific/Physics/PhysicalQuantities.py module (Last revision: 2007-5-25)
written by Konrad Hinsen <hinsen@cnrs-orleans.fr> with contributions from Greg Ward and Berthold Hoellmann.

Most of the additions to Hinsen's version were done by Nidhi R. Patel and Bret R. Beck <beck6@llnl.gov>
with feedback from Caleb M. Mattoon, Neil Summers and David Brown.

The values of physical constants are taken from the 2010 recommended values from
CODATA. Other conversion factors (e.g. for British units) come from various 
sources. The correctness of all entries in the unit table cannot be guaranteed,
so use this at your own risk.

-----------------------------------
Issues or features to be aware of
-----------------------------------

This section describes several oddities about :py:class:`PQU`.

    - Units 'oz', 'lb' and 'ton' (i.e., ounce, pound and ton respectively) are units of mass and not force.
      As example, the unit 'psi' (i.e., pounds per square inch) is equivalent to about '32.174 ft / s**2 * lb / inch**2'.

    - In the following, the first line produces a significantDigits that is small but correct per :py:class:`PQU` 
      rules as the number of significant digits is determined by the '1'.

>>> from pqu import PQU
>>> b1 = PQU.PQU( '1 Bohr' )
>>> b2 = b1.inBaseUnits( )
>>> print(b2)
5.e-11 m
>>> print(b2.value.info( ))
value = 5.29177208114537818e-11, significantDigits = 1, order = -11, isPercent = False
>>> 
>>> b3 = PQU.PQU( 1, 'Bohr' )        # this yields significantDigits = 16.
>>> b4 = b3.inBaseUnits( )
>>> print(b4)
5.291772081145378e-11 m
>>> print(b4.value.info( ))
value = 5.29177208114537818e-11, significantDigits = 16, order = -11, isPercent = False

    - The temperature units are Kelvin (i.e., 'K'), Celsius ('degC'), Rankine ('degR') and Fahrenheit ('degF').
      Two of these units (i.e., 'degC' and 'degF') cannot be used with any other unit including itself. That is,
      PQU( value, 'degC' ) and PQU( value, 'degF' ) are the only allowed forms when 'degF' or 'degC' are present.
      The two absolute temperature units (i.e., 'K' and 'degR') have no such restriction. As an example, heat 
      capacity can be expressed in units of 'W/(m * K)' or 'BTU/(hr * ft * degR)' but cannot be expressed in units
      of 'W/(m * degC)' or 'BTU/(hr * ft * degF)'.
      Any temperature unit can be converted to another temperature unit. For example,

>>> from pqu import PQU
>>> t1 = PQU.PQU( '40 degC' )
>>> print(t1.convertToUnit( 'degF' ))
104. degF
>>> print(t1.getValueAs( 'K' ))
313.15
>>> print(t1.convertToUnit( 'degR' ))
564. degR

    - :py:class:`PQU`, actually :py:class:`PhysicalUnit`, allows the unit to have values. For example 'm/s/25**3' is currently a valid
      unit and stored that way.  This should probably not be allowed and will probably be 
      deprecated (i.e., do not rely on it).
      The following illustrates the issue:

>>> from pqu import PQU
>>> c1 = PQU.PQU( '2.23 c' )
>>> print(c1)
2.23 c
>>> print(c1.getValueAs( 'm/s' ))
668537181.34
>>> print(c1.convertToUnit( 'km / s' ))
6.69e5 km/s
>>> print(c1.getValue( ))
668537.18134
>>> 
>>> c2 = PQU.PQU( '2.23 c' ) / 3
>>> print(c2)
0.743 c
>>> print(c2.getValueAs( 'm/s' ))
222845727.113
>>> print(c2.convertToUnit( 'km / s' ))
2.23e5 km/s
>>> print(c2.getValue( ))
222845.727113
>>> 
>>> c3 = PQU.PQU( '2.23 c / 3' )
>>> print(c3)
2.23 c/3
>>> print(c3.getValueAs( 'm/s' ))
222845727.113
>>> print(c3.convertToUnit( 'km / s' ))
2.23e5 km/s
>>> print(c3.getValue( ))
222845.727113
>>> 
>>> print(c1 == c2, c1 == c3, c2 == c3)
False False True
>>> 
>>> print(PQU.PQU( '2.23 2. * c / 3**2 / pi' ))
2.23 c*2.0/9/3.14159265359

    - Use fractions.Fraction in units.
    - Added uncertainty to data in pqu_constants.py and supporting logic.

    arguments can be either None, a :py:class:`PhysicalUnit` or a string that represents a :py:class:`PhysicalUnit` (e.g., "m", "",
